> An IPFS bytes exchange to allow any IPFS node to become a Filecoin retrieval provider
> and retrieve content from Filecoin

## Highlights

- IPFS exchange interface like Bitswap
- Turn any IPFS node into a Filecoin retrieval provider (YES, that means you will earn FIL when we launch on mainnet!)
- New content is dispatched via Gossipsub and stored if enough space is available
- IPFS Plugin to wrap the default Bitswap implementation and fetch blocks from Filecoin if not available on the public IPFS network
- Upload and retrieve directly from Filecoin if not secondary providers cache the content (Coming Soon)

## Background

To speed up data retrieval from Filecoin, a secondary market allows clients to publish their content ids to a network of providers
in order to retrieve it faster and more often at a cheaper price. This does not guarrantee data availability and so should be used
in addition to a regular storage deal. You can think of this as the CDN layer of Filecoin. This library is still very experimental 
and more at the prototype stage so feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestion or would like to contribute!

## Install

As a cli:

clone the repo then run:
```
$ make install
```

As a library:

```
$ go get github.com/myelnet/go-hop-exchange
```

As an IPFS plugin:

[Please follow the instructions in the plugin repo](https://github.com/myelnet/go-ipfs-hop-plugin)

## cli Usage

### `hop start`

Starts an ipfs daemon ready to provide content

## Library Usage

1. Import the package.

```go
package main

import (
	hop "github.com/myelnet/go-hop-exchange"
)

```

2. Initialize a blockstore, graphsync, libp2p host and gossipsub subscription.

```go
var ctx context.Context
var bstore blockstore.Blockstore
var ps *pubsub.PubSub
var host libp2p.Host
var ds datastore.Batching
var gs graphsync.GraphExchange
var ks keystore.Keystore

exch, err := hop.NewExchange(
		ctx,
		hop.WithBlockstore(bstore),
		hop.WithPubSub(ps),
		hop.WithHost(host),
		hop.WithDatastore(ds),
		hop.WithGraphSync(gs),
		hop.WithRepoPath("ipfs-repo-path"),
		hop.WithKeystore(ks),
		hop.WithFilecoinAPI(
			"wss://filecoin.infura.io",
			http.Header{
				"Authorisation": []string{"Basic <mytoken>"},
			},
		)
	)

blocks := bserv.New(bstore, exch)
dag := dag.NewDAGService(n.blocks)

```
`WithFilecoinAPI` is optional and if not provided, the node only supports free transfers
and will charge 0 price per byte to client requests for content it serves. This is mostly
for testing purposes.

3. When getting from the DAG it will automatically query the network

```go
var dag ipld.DAGService
var ctx context.Context
var root cid.Cid

node, err := dag.Get(ctx, root)
```

4. Clients can anounce a new deal they made so the content is propagated to providers
this is also called when adding a block with `dag.Add`.

```go
var ctx context.Context
var root cid.Cid

err := exch.Announce(ctx, root)
```

5. We're also exposing convenience methods to transfer funds or import keys to the underlying wallet

```go
var ctx context.Context
var to address.Address

from, err := exch.Wallet().DefaultAddress() 

err = exch.Wallet().Transfer(ctx, from, to, "12.5")
```

## Design principles

- Composable: Hop is highly modular and can be combined with any ipfs, data transfer, Filecoin or other exchange systems.
- Lightweight: we try to limit the size of the build as we are aiming to bring this exchange to mobile devices. We do not import core implementations such as go-ipfs or lotus directly but rely on shared packages.
- Do one thing well: there are many problems to solve in the decentralized storage space. This package only focuses on
  routing and retrieving content from peers in the most optimal way possible.
- KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. We take a naive approach to everything and try not to reinvent the wheel. Filecoin is already complex enough as it is.
